To install:
Put the pre-packed PBO in your "@ExileServer\addons\" directory. It should be alongside "exile_server" and "exile_server_config".


OPTIONAL:
Download the a3_dms folder and edit the config.sqf to your preferences.
Repack the a3_dms folder with a PBO tool and follow the "To install:" steps :D
